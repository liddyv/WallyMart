"# WallyMart"

Wallymart has asked you to take on AmazingCo in the online e-commerce space.
Wallymart can't seem to catch up, but they have identified several areas that are
crucial to a successful e-commerce site:
• high quality customer reviews
• large selection of products
• fast delivery (Not yet implemented)
You know Wallymart does really well in physical in-store space. You also know
Wallymart has appetite to radically change the way their e-commerce store is
designed today.
You are in the driver seat.
Option #1: Design a web store complete with products, reviews, ordering
capabilities, and delivery. You will own this end to end meaning that Wallymart
has decided to even own the delivery of the products and not outsource to USPS,
UPS, etc.
